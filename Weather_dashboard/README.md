# 30day-Devops-Challenge

This will serve as a guide you to building a simple weather dashboard using AWS services like S3, Athena, and the OpenWeather API. This project demonstrates how to make use of these services to collect, store, query, and visualize weather data.

This project demonstrates a basic framework for building a weather dashboard using AWS services. You can further enhance this project by:
1. Adding more features like weather forecasts, historical data analysis, and real-time alerts.
2. Integrating with other AWS services like AWS IoT for real-time data streaming.
3. Building a user-friendly web interface for the dashboard.
